  Swiftlint
summary: |
  Generates swiftlint reports in different formats, compatible with Bitrise test reports add-on
description: |
  This step generates the swiftlint report and saves it to a file in the bitrise deploy folder. It produces 2 environment variables, one with the report and the other one with the path to the report file. The first variable is useful if you want to p pass your report directly to somewhere, for example a Slack channel. The second variable is useful if you want to process the report file further, for example upload it to S3 or attach it to a pull request. Finally, this step is compatible with the Bitrise test reports add-on, so in case the linting fails, you can easily see the details there.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.

The file name depends on the reporter that was selected, for example for the `junit` reporter, the generated file name will have the extension `xml`, and for the `html` reporter it will be `html`). This is useful if you want to have this report in a separate file and do something with it, for example upload to S3.
